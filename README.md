Pipeline streamlining analysis of **target enrichment** sequencing data


# Tutorial using toy dataset

### STEP 1: READ MAPPING

### STEP 2: SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY

STEP 3: ORTHOLOGY ASSESSMENT

STEP 4: SAMPLE AND LOCUS FILTERING

STEP 5: TARGET LOCUS ALIGNMENT AND ALIGNMENT TRIMMING

STEP 6: MERGE OVERLAPPING ALIGNMENTS

STEP 7: CREATE REPRESENTATIVE REFERENCE SEQUENCES

STEP 8: ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT AND FILTERING
