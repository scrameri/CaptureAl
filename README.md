# CaptureAl Analysis Pipeline
Pipeline streamlining analysis of **target enrichment sequencing** data. This repository accompanies a scientific paper in review (Crameri et al. submitted), available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.07.471551v1).

### Download Capture Al scripts
To use this pipeline, clone the [CaptureAl repository](https://github.com/scrameri/CaptureAl) and follow the tutorial provided below. For each step, there is a limited number of scripts that have to be executed, and these scripts often execute other scripts located in the repository.

### Before you start
1) Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/scrameri/CaptureAl/blob/master/Install.md).
2) Determine how to implement [parallel computing](https://github.com/scrameri/CaptureAl/blob/master/Parallelize.md)

### Get started
Once the installation is complete, follow the tutorial step by step by viewing the numbered `.md` files, starting with [Sequence Quality Control](https://github.com/scrameri/CaptureAl/blob/master/Step0.1_Sequence_Quality_Control.md). Each step contains a link to the next step.
