# Supplementary Methods

## Merge physically neighboring reference sequences
- [merge_refseqs.R](ProbeSets/merge_refseqs.R)
  - Combine two phylocally close sequences into a single contiguous sequence using a reference genome to fill the gap.

## Create new probe sets
- [extract_probes.R](ProbeSets/extract_probes.R)
  - Extract tiled target enrichment probes from a list of target regions

## Filter BLAST+ hits for reciprocal best hits with minimum alignment length
- [filter_BLAST_Angiosperms353.R](ProbeSets/filter_BLAST_Angiosperms353.R)
  - Filter raw BLAST+ output for reciprocal best hits with minimum alignment length.
