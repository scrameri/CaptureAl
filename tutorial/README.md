### Choose between **GNU parallel** and **bsub**
Depending on your computing environment, the implementation of parallel computing may differ.

If you are working on a personal computer or computing server with multiple processors, [parallel](https://github.com/scrameri/CaptureAl/tree/master/tutorial/parallel) may be the way to go.

If you are working on a high-performance computing cluster, [bsub](https://github.com/scrameri/CaptureAl/tree/master/tutorial/bsub) may be the way to go.
